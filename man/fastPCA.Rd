\usage{
fastPCA(
  d,
  transpose = TRUE,
  scale = FALSE,
  center = TRUE,
  nPC = min(ncol(d) - 1, nrow(d) - 1, 30),
  weight.by.var = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{A matrix of numeric (in the RNA-Seq context, log counts).}

\item{transpose}{Logical. If `transpose`, samples are columns and features are rows.}

\item{scale}{Logical. Divide features by their standard deviation.}

\item{center}{Logical. Subtract features by their average.}

\item{nPC}{Integer. Number of Principal Component to be computed.}

\item{weight.by.var}{Logical. Weight PC by variables. If TRUE return a regular PCA.}

\item{...}{Other parameters passed to `irlba`.}
}
\value{
A list with the following element:
- sdev: the standard deviations of the principal components (i.e., the square roots of the eigenvalues of the covariance/correlation matrix, though the calculation is actually done with the singular values of the data matrix).
- rotation: the matrix of variable loadings (i.e., a matrix whose columns contain the eigenvectors). The function princomp returns this in the element loadings.
- x: if retx is true the value of the rotated data (the centred (and scaled if requested) data multiplied by the rotation matrix) is returned. Hence, cov(x) is the diagonal matrix diag(sdev^2). For the formula method, napredict() is applied to handle the treatment of values omitted by the na.action.
- center, scale: the centering and scaling used, or FALSE.
- n.obs: Number of samples
- propExplVar: proportion of explained variance by principals components on total variance.
- transform: a list containing the scaling (sdeviations) and centering factors (means) for each principal component.
