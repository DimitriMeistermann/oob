\title{Aggregate columns or rows of a matrix by a vector of factor}
\usage{
aggregMatPerVector(x, by, FUN = mean, byRow = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix of numeric.}

\item{by}{A vector of factor. Same size as number of row in \code{x} if  \code{byRow}, otherwise same size as number of columns.}

\item{FUN}{a function to compute the summary statistics which can be applied to all data subsets.}

\item{byRow}{Logical. Do the aggregation by row or by column. If NULL, determines automatically based on the size of \code{by}.}
}
\value{
A matrix of numeric. Aggregated dimension names are changed to match the levels of \code{by}.
}
\description{
Aggregate columns or rows of a matrix by a vector of factor
